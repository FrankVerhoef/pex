I love horror but true crime is my favorite thing to read. What kind of books have you read so far this year? Any you recommend? \\n<self>Oh yeah. I read this one book called The Butterfly Garden by Dot Huchinson. It was very dark and disturbing, but it was true crime/fiction. And it is still haunting me. It is a book in her collectors series. I have not yet been able to get myself to read the others in that series because it hit me pretty hard.\\n<other>Wow. That sounds like something I would really love. I just finished a book myself this morning about a serial killer. Do you read your books through Kindle? Or check them out from the library? \\n<self>I have kindle unlimited and the libby app, but I believe that particular one was on Kindle Unlimited. It was about teenaged girls being kidnapped and locked in a giant jar and turned into butterflies permanently after the man and his son had their way with them. So I had to lay off her books for a bit. Oh! I also read Billy Straight. that was on libby from my library. It is AMAZING. and it is a true crime story! What was the book you read?\\n<other>I have never heard of the Libby app. I'll have to check that out. I use Kindle because I have Amazon Prime and there are a ton of free books to find that way. The book I read was called Fatal Charm. It was about a husband who murdered two of his wives staging it to look like accidents each time. I hope to find another similar one to read next. What was Billy Straight about?\\n<self>Billy Straight is about a runaway kid that goes to hollywood and pretends to be in school but lives in a park. He witnesses a high profile murder and the cops are searching for him, thinking it was like an old bag lady, but confused as to why the possible witness had a presidents book wrapped in plastic out there. I have Amazon Prime as well. The first book I mentioned may be available on Prime reading. The libby app is an app where you can use your local library card to borrow books virtually and read them on your kindle.\\n<other>Oh ok. I have used other type of apps where it syncs up with the library number to check books out. I really love that option when checking out books now. Makes it so easy and convenient! \\n<self>Yeah it does! I am so happy to have someone to talk about books with! Not many people that I know appreciate them as much as they should. Plus everyone always wants to know what cool stunts I have been a part of, they forget that my favorite hobby  is reading everything ever written haha. \\n<other>You never know, with everything you have done in your past, I might read a book about YOU eventually! I can't even imagine what interesting stuff you'd be able to put in a book like that. My life is pretty monotonous so there wouldn't be much to put in a book about me. \\n<self>I mean, you said you like Stephen King. And Shawshank. I read that book. It was pretty boring. But it was also amazing. You never know what someone else might like to read. Also, doing stunts isn't always fun or exciting.

Are you familiar with it? \\n<other>Haha I think I may have read it years ago as a kid. Remind me what it's about?\\n<self>A character is shopping for hats and trying all types of hats on and none are suitable until he finds his old hat which he had taken off when he entered the hat store.  Not an actual classic, but lots of fun.\\n<other>Well my son is probably too old for it at this point, but I might volunteer to read it for the kids group at the library!\\n<self>I often take it out when I am having a rough day at work...it is mindless fun.  Almost as much as the stunt double work I just did.\\n<other>That sounds like an incredible amount of fun, but anything but mindless! What was your last stunt gig?\\n<self>I stood in for the actor who is playing Rocky Balboa in a remake of the original Rocky movie.  \\n<other>Wow, I'm super impressed! Tell me, what sorts of stunts do you have to do for this one? My imagination is running wild.\\n<self>Just imagine getting punched over and over again!\\n<other>Oof, talk about working hard for the money! Hopefully you're getting free visits to a massage therapist as part of the package!\\n<self>Only the real stars get that treatment.  The stunt doubles get old coffee and donuts in the trailer.\\n<sessionbreak>new session\\n<other>Do you have any new stunt double jobs coming  up?\\n<self>No, I don't have any at this time.\\n<other>You must have a lot of free time to read then.  Are you reading anything good now?\\n<self>I am reading The Butterfly Garden book, and it is good.  How was Fatal Charm?\\n<other>It was very good, I love true crime books!  I'm definitely on the look out for something similar.  I spend a lot of time in the library, so I'll find something.\\n<self>I also love True Crime!  Do you watch movies about True Crime as well?\\n<other>Of course, I'll watch or read anything true crime related.  My kindle is just filled with crime books.  What was your experience with The Butterfly Garden?\\n<self>It was so creepy it still enters my dreams.  I see you like Steven King movies, but what about his books?\\n<other>I love the books more!  I'll never watch a Steven King movie until I've read the book.  I think the IT movies may have ruined clowns for me forever.\\n<self>I did not see IT, but heard it was scary!\\n<other>Shawshank is actually one of my favorite movies and I thought the book was good as well.

One is a 68 and the other is a 66 Hertz clone.\\n<other>What are doing with those two?\\n<self>The 68 is a daily driver, at least during the summer.  The Hertz clone is a trailer queen.  I\\'m too afraid of paying for on  the road insurance.   \\n<other>How long have you been doing this?\\n<self>Ummmm, off and on, since 1989.  It\\'s a hobby that takes a lot of devotion.  It can be expensive, but it doesn\\'t always have to be.\\n<other>This sounds fun. Do you have any other hobby?\\n<self>Well I do like to listen to classic country, and I do have my two dogs, \"Baron Zemo\" and \"Spike.\"   What about you, how do you like wrestling as your day job?\\n<other>I\\'m not super into wrestling. \\n<self>Ah, now that makes sense.

Something to blast while driving with the top down, maybe even in your next restoration project.\\n<self>Yes!! Can\\'t wait to get back in the saddle with the restoration.  One of the one\\'s I am working on is a convertible.\\n<other>Sweet! I\\'m sure that will be an amazing ride once it\\'s finished.

Do you do any volunteering? \\n<self>Sadly not. I admire those who do though! Work keeps me so busy, and then I spent time on my car to relax. How did you get into wrestling as a job?\\n<other>I work out a few times a week and a trainer came over and asked if I was interested in wrestling and gave it a go! Have you ever wrestled? \\n<self>No I haven\\'t, I think I\\'d be terrible at it! Does it take you a long time to recover? It looks so physical and exhuasting!\\n<other>No different in my opinion then working out at the gym, keeps your mind focused! You should try it sometime, I think you would like wrestling!\\n<self>I can definitely see how it would be cathartic, although I\\'m so worried about getting my ass whooped I\\'m sure I\\'d be terrible.

I could learn some more of that, sometimes working on my car gets me so frustrated I can\\'t stand it, ha!\\n<other>I can see that.

Can you switch departments?\\n<self>At this point it's not possible without getting an even greater reduction in pay. I'm still toying with the idea of returning to school.\\n<other>That's not a bad idea, maybe go back to school and find your passion. Maybe you could even hit Disney before school started.\\n<self>Haha maybe I should go to school in Orlando.

The last red I really enjoyed, was a tawny port wine. \\n<self>Port is nice, too. It's quite heady and strong. So, what else have you been up to besides guzzling vino and smoking stogies?

My mom is way too traditional for me!\\n<other>I never drink or use drugs. I am 19 and just want to see my friends.\\n<self>I understand. When do you think you might be able to move?\\n<other>Not sure. I have a part time job at burger king. Do you work?\\n<self>I do. I coach swimming at the pool near my house.\\n<other>Awesome. My parents are just always on me about something. Are you moving soon?\\n<self>I'm still in school. I cannot move until I finish my degree\\n<other>That must be tough. What do you study?\\n<self>I want to be a computer programmer. Are you in school?\\n<other>Yes, I am studying education and working part time.\\n<self>That sounds interesting. Do you like it?\\n<other>Yes, I love it. How are your courses?\\n<self>They are great. I really like the challenge. What do you want to teach?\\n<other>I hope to teach elementary school. How much longer until you graduate?\\n<self>Three more years. I feel like I wil never get out. How about you?\\n<other>Same for me! Looking forward to being done and out of my parents house!\\n<self>Things are so strict. My family is from india, so they just don't get it.\\n<sessionbreak> 3 hours ago\\n<other>Does your college have a dorm? Mine just called, I forgot I was even on the waiting list, and I get to move out! Check into it okay?\\n<self>Oh wow, that sounds great! I'm envious that you're able to move out. I can't move out. My college has a dorm but I'm not able to move out for now. Do you think you'll be able to concentrate on your studies while living in a dorm?\\n<other>I have always loved to study, so that should not be a problem. I don't like to party, I do want to hang out and maybe have a few video game or movie nights\\n<self>Maybe I can come visit you in your dorm room so I feel more like I'm in college and not living with my parents. Do you think you'll try to form a study group?\\n<other>Oh yes. I am all about meeting to study together. I have not had one in a year or two, but we used to do like every week a different person would get their parents to buy lunch or dinner, depending on when the meeting was. Like now, I guess that it would have to be one of us haha. But we would have like pizza and pop or burgers and fries. One girl always brought edible arrangement fruit bouquets and those were amazing! We all loved her day. They came with like caramel and yogurt fruit dip! Would you consider joining a group like that? \\n<self>Oh yes, that would be great! I'd love to join a group like that. I feel like that would really make me feel like I'm part of a group and not just going to class every day and going back to my parent's hosue. \\n<other>We can even have slumber parties to watch a movie after if the dorm allows sleeping over. Idk, I have to find out. But like a once a week slumber party with food and a movie would be amazing! And I have access to HBO Max, so we can watch a newly released movie without having to pay for it like once or twice a month!\\n<self>Oh wow!  That's great! That sounds like a ton of fun. Studying turned into fun, who would've thought! I'm sure the dorm room would allow I would think.\\n<other>I hope so! Now I am more excited! We have to decide what subjects we can study together and which ones we will have to like just help out with. Like if you are taking algebra, then I can help, but I am taking a higher math. But if we are both taking BIO, we can study that together!\\n<self>That sounds good, I'm definitely taking BIO right now. It's honestly kind of a waste of time though because it's not my major but pre-requisites suck. I wish they weren't a thing at all. Seems like a waste of money.\\n<other>Yeah. I am working on getting my childhood education degree concentration in my favorite subject, math. But I have to take English and Bio and Art. I won't be teaching any of that so IDK why they are forcing me to take them. But I like to learn so. Oh well I guess.\\n<self>I know, don't you hate that? But like you said, I like to learn too! Just lots of money. \\n<sessionbreak> 1 hour ago\\n<other>I decided I could probably use some study help with bio after all\\n<self>So will you get a study group started to help with that?\\n<other>Yes I'm taking to a couple of my classmates to see if they can help me set one up. \\n<self>That sounds like a good idea. I don't like bio much, so I would definitely join a study group to help!\\n<other>Well once I have one together I will let you know so you can join also. How's the rest of your classes going? \\n<self>That would be great, thanks! The rest of my classes are going well. I still enjoy them, but I don't have much time to socialize.\\n<other>Yes I am in the same situation. Studying is taking up so much of my time but I trying to come out with the perfect Gpa score so that's what it takes. \\n<self>That is a great goal! My traditional parents would be very happy if I had a perfect GPA as well. I am hoping to get as close as I can. I would love to visit the dorms sometime. \\n<other>I'm sure you will get it. You are also studying very hard I'm sure you parents are so proud of you. You should defiantly come visit and I will show you around. \\n<self>Thanks, that's nice of you to say, and it would be great to have someone to show me around! The campus seems so large, I would probably get lost easily. How is your part time job going?\\n<other>Yes it very large but you soon get used to getting around. And it's going well but I wish I had more time in my days to get everything I need done. But I do like having a little break from school work. \\n<self>Do you enjoy working at Burger King? Does it pay well?\\n<sessionbreak>new session\\n<other>I got called in for a shift at work.\\n<self>I hear you, that sounds rough. Hope you had enough rest. Are you going in, or turning down the offer? \\n<other>I'm going in, I could use the extra hours.\\n<self>Money is a good thing, even if you have to give up time to get it. I've got a bunch of reading to do this week, for school. \\n<other>Is there any particular study you'll be doing the reading for?\\n<self>I'm studying a computer coding language. Very repetitive. How about your studies? \\n<other>I'm done with my studies. What made you pic computer coding as a subject of study?\\n<self>Well that was quick, and so much detail there! heheh. Coding is something my mind does very well, and it just makes sense to me, to work through. No studies, and just moved to the dorms. What's that like? \\n<other>It's good. I've been enjoying my free time now and can partake in more of my hobbies. How long have you been coding for?\\n<self>A few years now, although I guess it takes a few years to good, just like your hobbies. Tell me one specific hobby you have!\\n<other>I've just been binging a lot of hbo lately. Mostly catching up on old tv shows. Do you have hbo max?\\n\", \"<self>I'm not sure, would have to check with my parents on that. Lately, haven't been hunting for things to watch.

If not, are you able to have a vet come to you?\\n<other>I should be able to do that but I'm worried about what it will cost.  Gosh, this couldn't have come at a worse time.  I'm busy with work and also don't need this extra expense.\\n<self>Well I hope your cow gets better! How long have you had your cow?\\n<other>I've had her for about three years.  She was born on my parents' farm and they gave her to me to keep as a pet.  How close is your robot to being completed?\\n<self>I am still a few weeks out, I had to order a specific part and shipping has been delayed. I am looking forward to seeing how it turns out.\\n<other>Is it a male or female robot?  Or does it not have a gender like that?\\n<self>Well, it will have either a male or female voice but I haven't decided yet--I am going to include an option that allows you to change the sound of the voice.\\n<other>That's a cool idea.  You can change its voice depending on your mood.  Will you view it as a servant or as a friend?

They don't get sick!\\n<self>What would you have your robot do for you, if you got one>\\n<other>I would definitely have it be my assistant for my electrical work and have it do the more dangerous stuff. Maybe I will also have it groom my cow, since that's a fair amount of work as well. What about you?\\n<self>mine woill pay the bills, cook the meals, , clean the house, and do all the things I do not have time for.

Did they have to see any specialist or anything that helped the condition it was facing?\\n<other>I just gave it more hay I think the antibiotics have just finally kicked in so i'm so relieved because I was worried it could be a lot more serious\\n<self>I believe it, I personally don't have any pets, but for something that was a gift from your parents I'm sure it's very special and very relieving.  Maybe I'll consider getting a pet sometime, so I can have more interaction with something.  Does it feel good raising a pet?\\n<other>Oh I love having a pet, it just gives you something else to focus on and a reason to think of someone else. I just love animals though so I'm biased! What pet do you think you'd like?\\n<self>Maybe a cat.  I'm so busy with everything and building my robot that I would need something that isn't too demanding.  It's tough with how much work I am doing, but I think a cat would be good.  Have you played any Starcraft lately, or any other game?\\n<other>Aw yeah a cat would be perfect pet - enough to keep you busy and company but not too much hassle that it would negatively impact you. I have been too busy with my cow to properly get a chance to play unfortunately! How's the robot been going?\\n<self>It's been coming along fine.  Working right now on response coordination an and reply input.  I've had to outsource and implement a lot of different machine learning algorithms since the robot has to be able to respond to a lot of different variations.  I don't enjoy games, myself, but it sort of feels like one.  I still don't know what voice it should have, what do you think, male or female? \\n<other>I think I'd prefer a male voice - I don't know why! But I like when my devices are male voices but with like a British or Australian accent\\n<self>That's true and what I was leaning towards.

Oh guitar that is amazing, im sure it would be like riding a bike if you can get a hold of a guitar again. \\n<other>I\\'ll pick up my guitar if you promise to ask your parents to let you take music classes!\\n<self>That sounds like a deal to me. Be sure to let me know how you get on when you try to play it again, and i will let you know what my parents say.\\n<sessionbreak>new session\\n<other>Does your sister play any instruments or take any lessons?\\n<self>No, she doesn\\'t. What makes you ask that?\\n<other>I was just wondering because you like to play music.\\n<self>Yeah, I love it! My sister likes to listen to music but she doesn\\'t seem interested in actually playing it. How is your music going?\\n<other>It is going great, I have been listening to the Manic Street Preachers.\\n<self>Nice. Have you started learning to play harp? I remember you saying that you wanted to do that?\\n<other>Yes I have! I love playing the harp!\\n<self>How are you learning to play? Are you getting professional lessons or teaching yourself somehow?\\n<other>I have an instructor who is teaching me.\\n<self>That would be a very good choice. I can\\'t imagine trying to learn harp alone. \\n<other>It is a very beautiful instrument to play.\\n', \"<self>I've never tried it. Maybe I'll give it a try in the future after I learn piano.\\n\")\n",

I like Planet Earth and Blue Planet.Blue Planet II Is my favorite.\\n<sessionbreak>6 days 6 hours ago\\n<other>Hello, I\\'m sitting here with my dog. How are you?\\n<self>I\\'m well friend. Looking for new employment at the moment.\\n<other>What would be your dream job?\\n<self>A writer. I\\'m currently an er doctor.\\n<other>What was the worst accident you have seen in the er?\\n<self>A man had his throat slit in a home invasion\\n<other>That is very scary. I would rather stick to my knitting passion.\\n<self>I have a daughter who people say is a child prodigy\\n<other>What talents does she have?\\n<self>Math! I hate it! Lol. Do you have children?\\n<other>I\\'ve two children. They also enjoy math.\\n<self>That\\'s nice. What is your favorite movie?\\n<other>My favorite movie is clueless.\\n<self>Mine is friday! Although I do love clueless too!\\n<other>Do you think they will make another friday movie?\\n<self>Oh I hope so! That would be awesome.\\n<sessionbreak>6 days 2 hours ago\\n<other>I had a thought, since you are out of work right now anyway why don\\'t you give your dream job a shot?\\n<self>That sounds like a good Idea. I do write, but maybe I can start something for money\\n<other>I think you should! There are many platforms out there where you could start to monetize your writing.\\n<self>You are right. maybe I will write a clueless sequel\\n<other>There are a lot of people out there who would read that! It\\'s possible that you could get a publisher interested.\\n<self>I don\\'t know if I could write in that genre. Maybe I could with your help since you are the bigger fan.\\n<other>I might be able to offer some tips haha. Since you love Friday, you might even think about writing about that!\\n<self>I would love that. I just don\\'t know if I can write that kind of humor. For books I have always been more into fantasy or mystery. I think I just need to start. Have you started a career knitting or is that a hobby?\\n<other>It\\'s turned into a full-time job! I started out selling items on the side, but demand eventually got to be so great that I was able to make it my main gig. I love it!\\n<self>that is my dream. I have a good career to fall back on, but selling stories on the side would be great.\\n<other>Haha I would think that being an ER doctor is pretty lucrative. You could also look into ghostwriting. There\\'s a ton of demand for that.\\n<self>that maybe where I start. I\\'ll get my feet wet that way. yes it is lucrative I make a good living, but I would like a job where I am not responsible whether someone lives or dies.\\n<sessionbreak>6 days ago\\n<other>Are there any other books or genres you love?\\n<self>I really enjoy comedies. Did you see the witch movie with Bette Midler?\\n<other>I haven\\'t. I\\'m not really into comedies, because I don\\'t really have a sophisticated sense of humor. What genre do you think your first book will be?\\n<self>it would be the kind of comedy that clueless is. Doyou not think of clueless as a comedy?\\n<other>It is definitely a comedy, but I guess it is a special case because I\\'ve watched it so many times! Other comedies don\\'t really do it for me. I don\\'t know why!\\n<self>interesrting! do you like drams a little more?\\n<other>Yeah, I think so. But what I enjoy the most is nature documentaries. I like learning new things, and so I\\'ll sometimes spend the whole day knitting and watching wildlife on tv!\\n<self>do you like more of the nature channel  or more of things like jaques ciusteau?\\n<other>I like the BBC series Planet Earth and Blue Planet! Have you seen those?\\n<self>i have. I like blue planety better. which is your favorite\"\\n<other>My favorite is Blue Planet II. I think the music is just top notch.

They\\'re so alien-looking.\\n<self>have you seen the penguin movies?\\n<sessionbreak>new session\\n<other>How has your job search been going this week?\\n<self>I\\'ve had a couple if interviews.  Wish me luck. I\\'m ready to work. \\n<other>I feel that, I am having trouble looking for work right now.\\n<self>I feel you. Do you make enough to survive from knitting?\\n<other>I make enough \\n<self>At least you have something to fall back on. I\\'ve always wanted to be able to make things with my hands. That has to be so satisfying. \\n<other>That is true. You should try out knitting!\\n<self>I don\\'t even know where to get started. Where should i start?\\n<other>Go on youtube and start learning!\\n<self>I don\\'t know if i have the patience. It looks complicated. \\n<other>Trust me anyone can learn how to knit.\\n', '<self>I will give it a try. I would love to pass down some of my creations to my family. \\n')\n"
