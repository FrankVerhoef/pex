      "Aside from that, I like snow peas and snap peas.\n",
      "It tastes really good with bacon or prosciutto wrapped around it!\n",
      " Although, then it wouldn't be vegetarian.\n",
      "I've been listening to their entire discography and I was surprised to find I loved a lot of their songs, even though its super different than my usual tastes!\n",
      " I really liked the songs Burnin Up and Year 3000!\n",
      " I know they are kind of old school, but they felt nostalgic to me.\n",

      "It's good that you're finding a job in readiness for when you leave university.\n",
      "I've seen too many people leave it too last minute and then end up struggling to find a position somewhere.\n",
      "You seem like you have your brain switched on, I like that.\n",

      "I'd like to try that someday when the kids are older.\n",
      "then at least we would have something to look forward to every year\n",
      " it's like biking, where one good push will send you sailing for quite a ways.\n",
      "it's easier than you'd think.\n",
      "After two or so, they actually become less of a burden because you've already got a couple, so you're already buying food, having them go outside to the bathroom, etc...\n",
      "Plus, they start to keep each other company and wear each other out.\n",
      "They learn so much about lifespan and caring for others.\n",
      "They are living things, with feelings and needs.\n",
      "the next on my list to try is cashew cheese, which i have heard is superior, so i am excited to try it.\n",
      "i hear it makes great nachos, and i miss nachos so much!\n",
      "the only thing I noticed about it is if I leave it in the fridge too long, it doesn't mold.\n",
      "That is a little weird to me, but still it's the most delicious, meltable vegan cheese that I've found.\n",
      " So obviously the typical touristy things, but also some lesser known attractions would be interesting as well.\n",
      "The zoo there is small, but well kept.\n",
      "There's also the Bronx Zoo, which is completely enormous.\n",
      "Then there are fun things like the Brooklyn Flea or walking over some of the bridges to get a sense of the city.\n",
      "Every student was able to make a page about their hobbies, with pictures.\n",
      "They really enjoyed the web page class, and I did, too!\n",
      "That story kind of brings me back to my carefree teenage years, first experimenting with webpages.\n",
      "At least I got some of that feeling back, and was more socially connected, when I started hosting an official webpage for my grandma.\n",
      "It is so interesting!\n",
      "I am glad you are enjoying it.\n",
      "It's written in a way that makes it a very quick read.\n",
      "Those aren't my favorite animals, but that's okay.\n",
      "Oh okay, we can skip it if you will feel scared.\n",
      "She never leaves the house and has mental health issues.\n",
      "t's really good!\n",
      "And despite what you say, I bet once we are actually there in the field, you might change your mind and hop on with me.\n",
      "I promise I'll pick the tamest one if you might agree to ride it with me, even if it is just for a couple of minutes.\n",
      "And the sunrises are to die for.\n",
      "And that way YOU can hike with the kids and I get to take my time setting up the movies!\n",
      "Sorry about that, you don't want to scare yourself away from running by doing too much at first.\n",
